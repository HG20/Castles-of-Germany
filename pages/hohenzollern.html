                  <p class="my-4">Poised atop a steep, conical cliff, and located in the heart of Baden-Württemberg is Hohenzollern Castle. For centuries Hohenzollern Castle has been home to Swabian counts and princes, Prussian kings and German emperors.

                        Originally built in the 11th century, and snuggly located between Lake Constance, the Black Forest and Stuttgart, this proud fortress offers majestic panoramic views of more than 100 kilometers of the rolling forest.
                        
                        Over the years Hohenzollern Castle has been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times, with only the St Michel Chapel miraculously surviving destruction. The structure which exists today was rebuilt in the 19th century in the English Neo-Gothic style but still houses much of the royals’ old treasures. Enjoy the castle’s Treasure Chamber with its shining knights’ armors, Fredrick the Great’s uniform, the diamond and sapphire encrusted Prussian royal crown, a silver-embroidered dress belonging to Queen Louise, and the famous snuff box that once saved Frederick the Great’s life.
                        
                        The castle is open year round and offers guided tours every day. Have your little princess or knight get the royal treatment with their own royal red cloaks and fancy felt slippers to make the castle visit even more fun. Visit the castle’s café for freshly baked cakes, Swabian specialties and other regional culinary delights, and sip on beer and enjoy the summer sun in the castle’s summertime beer gardens. With all that it has to offer, the list of castles in Germany isn’t complete without Hohenzollern Castle.</p>
