                  <p class="my-4">Schönburg Castle was first mentioned in history some time between 911 and 1166. Destroyed in 1689 by French soldiers during the Palatinate wars, the castle remained in ruins for 200 years until it was acquired by a German-American family. The family restored it, and later the town council re-entered into ownership and management of the castle before leasing it to another family some years later. The castle gardens are truly spectacular, and are a must-see no matter how long you’re staying. Many balconies decorate the property, and views of the Rhine Valley go on for days.

                        Since 1957 the Hüttl family has been living at the castle on a long-term lease. They currently operate an immensely successful restaurant there as well as one of the best castle hotels in Germany. Boasting a wonderfully romantic atmosphere, their restaurant Knappenstube has unbeatable views of the Engehöller Valley. The ambience of Schönburg Castle is nearly impossible to beat.</p>
