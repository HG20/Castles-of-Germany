                        Believed to have origins dating back to 1100, French King Louis XIV had his troops obliterate Reichsburg Castle in 1689. The castle remained a colorful stone ruin for 180 years until wealthy Berlin businessman Louis Ravené decided to buy the ruins and rebuild the castle in 1868. But instead of restoring the castle to its original Romanesque style and condition, Ravené had his architects create a Neo-Gothic castle that could serve as a summer residence for his family.
                        
                        Being one of the biggest castles in Germany, Reichsburg Castle offers different tours with persons of varied interests in mind. Go on a landscape garden tour, a ghost tour or the night watchman tour. Each offers special insights, riveting stories and historical facts about the castle.
                        
                        Reichsburg Castle remains one of the best castles to see in Germany not only because of their tours, but because of the other fun activities and events they offer. Prepare to be dazzled by highly skilled eagles, falcons and vultures as they strut their stuff during the falconry performances, and wrap up the day by sitting down to The Knights’ Meal which features local wine, historical cuisine and performances by jesters and minstrels.
                        
                        If you’re not a tour type of person, you can simply amble at your own pace up to the castle and drink in the stunning view of Cochem and the Moselle Valley. The walk up to the castle, while steep, is an enjoyable experience that takes about 20 minutes from the center of the town, and you can chill out in the castle’s gardens free of charge. If you don’t mind chilly temperatures, the colorful leaves and the sparkling snow make fall and winter an absolutely gorgeous time to visit Reichsburg Castle.</p>
