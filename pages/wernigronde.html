                  <p class="my-4">The Wernigerode Castle was originally a medieval fort used as a stronghold by German emperors on hunting excursions in the Harz during the Middle Ages. The castle was rebuilt into a Renaissance fortress in the 16th century prior to its unfortunate destruction during a 17th-century war. After the war, Count Ernest of Stolberg-Wernigerode began reconstructing the castle remains as a romantic castle residence for himself.

                        First established in the 12th century, the castle has undergone many changes over time. Wernigerode Castle has changed architecturally from Neo-Gothic to a Renaissance fortress and finally to a Baroque masterpiece. The present-day building, finished in the late 19th century, is similar in style to the famed Neuschwanstein Castle, though its foundations are much older.
                        
                        Parts of the castle have been open to the public since 1930. Today, museum tours lead visitors through more than 40 furnished grand living quarters of the German nobility, partly furnished with timeworn original pieces. Their stunning terraces are always a favorite among guests.
                        
                        The grand turreted stone and half-timber castle with magnificent views ranks as a major example of the North German historismus building style. Overlooking the medieval town of Wernigerode, cameras are more than necessary for a visit to Wernigerode Castle.
