                  <p class="my-4">Once upon a time, long before the famed Neuschwanstein Castle was built, there was another castle called Hohenschwangau Castle.

                        Hohenschwangau Castle had long been the residence of rulers but had become a ruin for some time before it was acquired by King Ludwig’s father, Maximilian II, in the 19th century. Maximilian II rebuilt and redecorated Hohenschwangau Castle in a romantic Gothic period style, perfect for a summer and hunting residence for his family.
                        
                        The castle’s walls were beautifully painted with Germanic historic legends. And this, many argue, shaped the shy King Ludwig’s interest in fairy tales and legends. After Maximilian II’s death, Ludwig II spent a lot of time at the castle and designed rooms on his own terms.
                        
                        If Hohenschwangau Castle’s picturesque location isn’t enough encouragement, visit the castle and walk the halls where one of Europe’s most mysterious kings grew up. Slightly south of Neuschwanstein, Hohenschwangau Castle is beautiful and nearby. Get tickets to tour both castles to really watch history come alive.</p>
