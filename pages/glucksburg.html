                  <p class="my-4">Glücksburg Castle is one of the most important Renaissance castles in northern Europe. The castle was built between 1582 and 1587 by the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg at the site of Ryd Abbey, a medieval monastery that had occupied that location until the reformation.

                        Intriguingly, bricks and other building material from the monastery were partly reused in building the striking castle, even though the decision was made to flood the monastery to create a large pond to surround the castle.
                        
                        Glücksburg Castle is built on 2.5 meters of granite foundation emerging from the pond. The pond was employed as both a defensive structure for its habitants and as fishing grounds.
                        
                        In the 20th century, the formal gardens were remodeled into English landscape parks, though sections of the older garden before it remain. The orangery was renovated in 1827 into a neoclassical building, and is now used for art expositions and concerts. The Glücksburger Rosarium was created in the area of the former castle nursery in the early 1990s and now grows more than 500 different roses.
